    <h2>ðŸ‘‹ Hi, I'm Yetrina</h2>

    <p>
      I'm a fullstack developer who enjoys playing and collecting board games.
    </p>

    <p>
      In my 15+ years in IT, I've mostly developed enterprise web applications
      using Java and Spring. I've also maintained a few Ruby on Rails
      applications along the way. Currently I'm improving my front-end skills by
      learning Vue.js and Node.js.
    </p>
    <p>
      Away from the keyboard, I enjoy playing board games and video games,
      painting miniatures and gardening. My "shelf of shame" (unplayed board
      games) is growing slowly but steadily.
